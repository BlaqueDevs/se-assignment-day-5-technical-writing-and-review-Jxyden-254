Why: "Establish a connection" is wordy and formal. "Connect" is short, simple, and direct.
3. Data and Information:

Instead of: "Retrieve the information."
Use: "Get the information."
Why: "Retrieve" is a formal term, "Get" is easier to understand.
Instead of: "Aggregate the data."
Use: "Combine the data." or "Add up the data."
Why: "Aggregate" is a technical term used in data analysis. "Combine" or "add up" are more familiar.
Instead of: "Disseminate the report."
Use: "Share the report." or "Send out the report."
Why: "Disseminate" is a formal word. "Share" or "send out" are more common
